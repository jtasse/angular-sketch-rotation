This project creates an animated scene with [Angular](https://angular.io/) and [P5JS](https://p5js.org/). It is based heavily on the examples [here](https://editor.p5js.org/icm/sketches/BJKWv5Tn) and [here](https://github.com/andrewevans0102/angular-sketchpad).

To run it locally just run `npm run start`.
